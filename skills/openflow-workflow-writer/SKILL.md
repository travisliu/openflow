description: Create, review, validate, and improve OpenFlow workflow scripts that orchestrate Codex, Gemini, and mock provider agents through agent(), parallel(), pipeline(), phase(), and log().
---

# Purpose

Use this skill when the user wants Codex to create, review, debug, validate, or improve an OpenFlow workflow script.

OpenFlow is a local-first command-line workflow runner for orchestrating external coding-agent CLIs. A good OpenFlow workflow expresses orchestration intent in a constrained JavaScript / TypeScript-like DSL, keeps provider behavior isolated, uses structured output where useful, and remains observable through reports and artifacts.

Use this skill for requests such as:

- Create an OpenFlow workflow for code review, CI/CD, finance, accounting, research, migration checks, test triage, documentation review, or other repeatable multi-agent work.
- Convert an informal workflow idea into an OpenFlow workflow file.
- Review an existing workflow for API correctness, validation errors, concurrency risks, provider selection, structured output, and CI usability.
- Explain how to run, validate, configure, or troubleshoot an OpenFlow workflow.
- Refactor a workflow to use `parallel()` or `pipeline()` appropriately.

Do not use this skill when the user only wants a general explanation of agent orchestration, generic JavaScript help unrelated to OpenFlow, or implementation work inside the OpenFlow runtime itself unless the user explicitly asks to modify OpenFlow.

# References

Consult these files when needed:

- `references/api-document.md`: Syntax reference for workflow file shape, `agent()`, `parallel()`, `pipeline()`, `phase()`, `log()`, providers, reports, artifacts, exit codes, templates, and common validation mistakes.
- `references/cli-commands.md`: Command reference for `openflow run`, `openflow validate`, and `openflow doctor`.
- `references/configuration.md`: Configuration reference for `.openflow/config.yaml`, provider settings, security settings, reporting settings, and precedence rules.

When the user asks for exact syntax, validation constraints, command options, configuration behavior, or troubleshooting, prefer the references over memory.

# Workflow

When using this skill:

1. Clarify the user's workflow goal from the prompt.
   - Identify the domain, target inputs, expected outputs, providers, and whether the workflow is local, CI, or documentation-oriented.
   - If the user provides enough information, proceed without asking follow-up questions.

2. Choose the right OpenFlow pattern.
   - Use a single `agent()` when one agent can complete the task.
   - Use `parallel()` when independent reviews or analyses can run concurrently and then be summarized.
   - Use `pipeline()` when many items must pass through the same ordered stages.
   - Use fan-out / fan-in when multiple independent branches should be summarized by a final agent.

3. Draft valid workflow metadata first.
   - `export const meta = ...` must be the first top-level statement.
   - Include a static `name` and `description`.
   - Include `phases` when the workflow has meaningful milestones.
   - Use only static literal metadata values.

4. Write the workflow using only supported DSL primitives.
   - Use `agent()` for provider-backed tasks.
   - Use `parallel()` with task thunks, not already-started promises.
   - Use `pipeline()` with named stage objects.
   - Use `ctx.agent()` inside pipeline stage `run()` functions.
   - Use `phase()` to mark major progress points.
   - Use `log()` only for non-sensitive operational metadata.

5. Select providers intentionally.
   - Use `codex` for correctness, security, code reasoning, implementation review, and safety checks.
   - Use `gemini` for test strategy, operations review, broad synthesis, summarization, and cross-perspective aggregation.
   - Use `mock` for examples, deterministic CI checks, smoke tests, and workflows that must run without real credentials.
   - Let config or `--provider` provide defaults unless the workflow needs explicit per-agent provider choices.

6. Add structured output when downstream steps depend on machine-readable results.
   - Use JSON Schema for review findings, risk lists, plans, checklists, summaries, or classification output.
   - Keep schemas simple enough that providers can satisfy them reliably.
   - Set `structuredOutput: { transport: "auto" }` with `schema` unless there is a specific reason to choose another transport.
   - Use `transport: "prompt"` when you want schema instructions injected into the provider prompt explicitly.
   - Use `transport: "validate-only"` only when the prompt already contains exact output instructions and you only want local validation.
   - Do not use `transport: "native"` for current `codex`, `gemini`, or `mock` workflows; current adapters reject it.
   - Ask agents to return exactly one JSON object when a schema is required.

7. Make concurrency and failure behavior explicit when it matters.
   - Document expected `--concurrency`, `--timeout-ms`, and `--fail-fast` usage for CLI runs.
   - For `pipeline()`, choose `strategy`, `concurrency`, and `failFast` based on whether partial item failure should be tolerated.
   - Prefer item-tolerant behavior for analysis pipelines unless the user wants strict gating.

8. Add run instructions.
   - Include `openflow validate <workflow-file>` before `openflow run <workflow-file>`.
   - Include local commands and CI-friendly commands when relevant.
   - Suggest `--report json` for final machine-readable reports and `--report jsonl` for event streams.
   - Suggest `openflow doctor` when provider availability or config may be uncertain.

9. Review the workflow before finalizing.
   - Check metadata placement.
   - Check that all agent calls return promises correctly.
   - Check that `parallel()` receives functions.
   - Check that `pipeline()` stages are named objects.
   - Check that pipeline stages use `ctx.agent()`.
   - Check for secrets in prompts/logs.
   - Check that the final result is exported.

10. Provide a concise explanation of how to use or adapt the workflow.

# Rules

- Do not invent unsupported OpenFlow APIs.
- Do not use arbitrary imports, `require()`, filesystem APIs, process APIs, shell commands, or host capabilities inside workflow files.
- Do not place anything before `export const meta`.
- Do not use dynamic metadata values.
- Do not pass already-started promises into `parallel()`.
- Do not use anonymous callback shorthand as a pipeline stage.
- Do not call global `agent()` from inside a pipeline stage; use `ctx.agent()`.
- Do not assume automatic patch application, automatic commits, automatic merge, approval gates, DAG pipelines, retries, worktree isolation, container isolation, distributed execution, or resumable runs are available unless explicitly implemented.
- Do not log secrets, tokens, credentials, full private source dumps, or unnecessary raw provider output.
- Prefer explicit, reusable workflow files over vague prompts.
- Prefer validation and dry-run commands before real provider execution.
- Keep workflow scripts provider-agnostic except for intentional provider selection in `agent()` calls.
- In CI examples, prefer deterministic `mock` provider where the goal is smoke testing the workflow shape rather than getting real model output.
- When using `schema`, include `structuredOutput` only with supported transports: `"auto"`, `"prompt"`, or `"validate-only"` for current providers.

# Output format

When creating a workflow, return:

## Workflow

A complete OpenFlow workflow file in a JavaScript code block.

## How to run

Commands to validate, dry-run if useful, run locally, and run in CI.

## Design notes

Brief notes explaining the selected pattern, providers, concurrency, structured outputs, and failure behavior.

## Validation checklist

A short checklist of OpenFlow-specific correctness checks.

When reviewing a workflow, return:

## Summary

Overall assessment and risk level.

## Findings

For each issue:

- Severity: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- Location:
- Problem:
- Why it matters:
- Suggested fix:

## Corrected workflow

Include a corrected workflow only when the user asks for edits or when the fix is short enough to be useful.

## Commands to verify

List validation and run commands.

# Optional scripts

Use these helper scripts when relevant and available:

- `scripts/openflow-validate.sh`: Validate one or more workflow files with `openflow validate`.
- `scripts/openflow-smoke-run.sh`: Run a workflow with the mock provider and JSON report mode for deterministic smoke testing.

These scripts are optional helpers. If they do not fit the repository, show equivalent commands instead.

# Examples

## Example request: create a parallel review workflow

User request:

```text
Create an OpenFlow workflow that uses Codex to review correctness and security while Gemini reviews tests and operations, then Gemini summarizes the results.
```

Example response workflow:

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "parallel-pr-review",
  description: "Run parallel correctness, security, test, and operations reviews, then summarize the results.",
  phases: ["review", "summarize"]
};

phase("review");

const reviews = await parallel({
  correctness: () => agent({
    id: "correctness-review",
    provider: "codex",
    prompt: "Review the change for correctness bugs, edge cases, and regression risks."
  }),

  security: () => agent({
    id: "security-review",
    provider: "codex",
    prompt: "Review the change for authentication, authorization, data exposure, and injection risks."
  }),

  tests: () => agent({
    id: "test-review",
    provider: "gemini",
    prompt: "Review the test plan and identify missing coverage or brittle tests."
  }),

  operations: () => agent({
    id: "operations-review",
    provider: "gemini",
    prompt: "Review operational risks, rollout risks, observability gaps, and rollback concerns."
  })
});

phase("summarize");

const summary = await agent({
  id: "review-summary",
  provider: "gemini",
  prompt: `Summarize these review results, deduplicate findings, and provide a merge recommendation:\n${JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2)}`
});

export default {
  reviews,
  summary
};
```

## Example request: create a pipeline workflow

User request:

```text
Create a workflow that processes several documents through extract, assess, and summarize stages.
```

Example response workflow:

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "document-risk-pipeline",
  description: "Process documents through extraction, risk assessment, and summary stages.",
  phases: ["analyze", "summarize"]
};

const documents = [
  "contracts/vendor-a.md",
  "contracts/vendor-b.md",
  "contracts/vendor-c.md"
];

phase("analyze");

const itemResults = await pipeline(
  documents,
  [
    {
      name: "extract-obligations",
      run: (documentPath, ctx) => ctx.agent({
        id: ctx.agentId("extract"),
        provider: "codex",
        prompt: `Extract obligations, deadlines, and risk-bearing clauses from ${documentPath}.`,
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            document: { type: "string" },
            obligations: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
            risks: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
          },
          required: ["document", "obligations", "risks"]
        },
        structuredOutput: {
          transport: "auto"
        }
      })
    },
    {
      name: "assess-risk",
      run: (extraction, ctx) => ctx.agent({
        id: ctx.agentId("risk"),
        provider: "codex",
        prompt: `Assess the severity and business impact of this extraction:\n${JSON.stringify(extraction, null, 2)}`
      })
    },
    {
      name: "summarize-item",
      run: (riskAssessment, ctx) => ctx.agent({
        id: ctx.agentId("summary"),
        provider: "gemini",
        prompt: `Create an executive summary for this assessment:\n${JSON.stringify(riskAssessment, null, 2)}`
      })
    }
  ],
  {
    label: "document-risk-pipeline",
    strategy: "item-streaming",
    concurrency: 3,
    failFast: false
  }
);

phase("summarize");

const summary = await agent({
  id: "portfolio-summary",
  provider: "gemini",
  prompt: `Create a portfolio-level summary from these item results:\n${JSON.stringify(itemResults, null, 2)}`
});

export default {
  itemResults,
  summary
};
```

## Example commands

```bash
openflow doctor
openflow validate workflows/parallel-pr-review.js
openflow run workflows/parallel-pr-review.js --provider mock --dry-run
openflow run workflows/parallel-pr-review.js --provider codex --concurrency 4 --timeout-ms 900000
openflow run workflows/parallel-pr-review.js --provider mock --report json
openflow run workflows/parallel-pr-review.js --report jsonl
```

# Quality checklist

Before returning a final OpenFlow workflow, confirm:

- `meta` is first and static.
- The workflow exports a final result.
- `phase()` names match declared phases when phases are declared.
- `parallel()` receives functions, not promises.
- `pipeline()` stages are named objects.
- Pipeline stages call `ctx.agent()`.
- Provider choices are intentional and explainable.
- Structured output schemas are valid JSON Schema objects.
- Structured output uses a supported transport: `auto`, `prompt`, or `validate-only`.
- CLI commands include validation before execution.
- Config assumptions are stated clearly.
- No unsupported APIs or out-of-scope capabilities are used.
