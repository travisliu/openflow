# OpenFlow CLI Commands

This document summarizes the command-line interface (CLI) commands and options for OpenFlow.

---

## Run a workflow

```bash
openflow run <workflow-file>
```

### Common options

```bash
--provider <codex|gemini|mock>
--arg key=value
--config <path>
--cwd <path>
--out <path>
--report <pretty|json|jsonl>
--concurrency <number>
--timeout-ms <number>
--max-agent-calls <number>
--max-observed-tokens <number>
--max-run-ms <ms>
--resume <run-id-or-path>
--no-cache
--background
--dry-run
--fail-fast
--verbose
```

### Examples

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts
openflow run workflows/review.ts --provider codex
openflow run workflows/review.ts --provider mock
openflow run workflows/review.ts --concurrency 2
openflow run workflows/review.ts --timeout-ms 600000
openflow run workflows/review.ts --resume <previous-run-id>
openflow run workflows/review.ts --no-cache
openflow run workflows/review.ts --max-observed-tokens 50000
openflow run workflows/review.ts --background
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report json
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
openflow run workflows/review.ts --fail-fast
```

Notes:

* `--timeout-ms` is per agent; `--max-run-ms` is the whole workflow wall-clock budget.
* Resume/cache reuses only successful agent calls from the same workflow hash.
* OpenFlow does not estimate tokens. It only records Codex JSONL usage after Codex reports it.

---

## Resume a pending workflow

```bash
openflow resume <run-id-or-path> [input]
openflow resume <run-id-or-path> --pause <pause-id> --input <value>
openflow resume <run-id-or-path> --pause <pause-id> --input-file decision.json
```

Examples:

```bash
openflow resume 20260610-abc123 "continue with option A"
openflow resume 20260610-abc123 --pause approve-plan --input '{"action":"approve"}'
```

Notes:

* `openflow resume` is for runs that stopped at `pause()`.
* If the run has exactly one pending pause, `--pause` can be omitted.
* A continuation creates a new run and safely resumes/cache-replays the previous run.
* Schema-backed pauses require JSON input.

---

## Observe runs

```bash
openflow list [--out <dir>] [--json]
openflow inspect <run-id-or-path> [--out <dir>] [--json]
openflow watch <run-id-or-path> [--out <dir>] [--jsonl]
openflow kill <run-id-or-path> [--out <dir>] [--signal SIGTERM]
```

`watch` follows `events.jsonl`. `inspect` reads artifacts and works for running, completed, failed, cancelled, and pending runs. Pretty output includes the observed usage summary when Codex reports usage.

---

## Validate a workflow

```bash
openflow validate <workflow-file>
```

### Example

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

### Validation checks include

* `meta` is the first top-level statement.
* `meta.name` and `meta.description` are present.
* Metadata is statically analyzable.
* Unsupported imports and restricted APIs are rejected.
* Supported `pipeline()` usage is accepted.
* Obviously invalid `pipeline()` usage is rejected.

---

## Check environment readiness

```bash
openflow doctor
```

### Checks include

* config file can be loaded.
* provider CLIs are present when configured.
* Codex CLI is available for Codex workflows.
* Gemini CLI is available for Gemini workflows.
* provider commands can be executed.
* secret-like environment values are not printed.
