# OpenFlow CLI

OpenFlow is a local-first command-line workflow runner for orchestrating coding-agent CLIs such as `codex exec` and `gemini -p`.

It lets engineers define constrained JavaScript-like workflows, run agent tasks sequentially or in parallel, capture structured results, and persist durable run artifacts for local debugging and CI automation.

> **Status:** MVP design / early implementation target. This README describes the intended MVP behavior and user-facing CLI contract.

---

## Why OpenFlow?

Modern coding agents are useful from the terminal, but larger engineering tasks often need more than one prompt or one agent run. OpenFlow provides a small orchestration layer around external coding-agent CLIs so you can:

- Split large engineering tasks into repeatable workflow files.
- Run multiple agent reviews in parallel.
- Use different providers for different tasks.
- Validate structured JSON output with JSON Schema.
- Capture prompts, stdout, stderr, normalized results, reports, and events.
- Use pretty terminal output locally or JSON/JSONL output in CI.
- Keep provider-specific details out of workflow logic.

OpenFlow does **not** implement its own coding agent. It coordinates external provider CLIs.

---

## MVP Features

The MVP scope includes:

- `openflow run <workflow-file>`
- `openflow validate <workflow-file>`
- `openflow doctor`
- Constrained workflow metadata parsing
- Workflow DSL functions:
  - `agent()`
  - `parallel()`
  - `phase()`
  - `log()`
- Provider adapters:
  - `mock`
  - `codex`
  - `gemini`
- Global concurrency limits
- Timeout handling
- Fail-fast mode
- JSON Schema validation for structured agent output
- Pretty, JSON, and JSONL reporters
- Durable artifact directories under `.openflow/runs/<runId>`
- Deterministic exit codes

Deferred post-MVP features include `pipeline()`, plugin providers, retries, worktree/container isolation, resumable runs, approval gates, automatic patch application, and static HTML reports.

---

## Requirements

OpenFlow is designed for Node.js-based projects and local or CI environments.

Recommended baseline:

- Node.js 20+
- npm, pnpm, or yarn
- Git, when running inside a repository
- Optional provider CLIs:
  - Codex CLI for the `codex` provider
  - Gemini CLI for the `gemini` provider

The `mock` provider is intended for tests, examples, and CI workflows that should not require real provider credentials.

---

## Installation & Usage

### Usage with npx

npx openflow --help
npx openflow doctor
npx openflow validate workflows/review.ts
npx openflow run workflows/review.ts
```

### Global installation

```bash
npm install -g openflow
openflow --help
openflow doctor
```

### Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx . --help
npx . run workflows/review.ts
```

### Local package smoke test

```bash
npm pack
npx ./openflow-0.1.0.tgz --help
npx ./openflow-0.1.0.tgz doctor
```

---

## Quick Start

Create a workflow file:

```ts
// workflows/review.ts
export const meta = {
  name: "parallel-review",
  description: "Review changed files with multiple coding-agent CLIs",
  phases: ["review", "summarize"]
};

phase("review");

const reviews = await parallel({
  codex: () => agent({
    id: "codex-review",
    provider: "codex",
    prompt: "Review the changed files for correctness issues."
  }),
  gemini: () => agent({
    id: "gemini-review",
    provider: "gemini",
    prompt: "Review the changed files for API design issues."
  })
});

phase("summarize");

const summary = await agent({
  id: "summary",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: `Summarize these reviews:\n${JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2)}`
});

export default {
  reviews,
  summary
};
```

Run it:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts
```

Validate it without invoking providers:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

Run a dry run:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --dry-run
```

---

## Using the Mock Provider

The mock provider is useful for local examples, tests, and CI jobs that should not call external model providers.

```ts
// workflows/mock-review.ts
export const meta = {
  name: "mock-review",
  description: "Example workflow using the mock provider"
};

phase("review");

const result = await agent({
  id: "mock-review",
  provider: "mock",
  prompt: "Review the changed files."
});

export default result;
```

Run:

```bash
openflow run workflows/mock-review.ts --provider mock
```

---

## CLI Commands

### `openflow run`

Runs a workflow file.

```bash
openflow run <workflow-file> [options]
```

Common options:

```bash
--provider <codex|gemini|mock>
--arg key=value
--config <path>
--cwd <path>
--out <path>
--report <pretty|json|jsonl>
--concurrency <number>
--timeout-ms <number>
--dry-run
--fail-fast
--verbose
```

Examples:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts
openflow run workflows/review.ts --provider codex
openflow run workflows/review.ts --concurrency 2
openflow run workflows/review.ts --timeout-ms 600000
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report json
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
openflow run workflows/review.ts --fail-fast
```

### `openflow validate`

Validates workflow metadata, syntax, and restricted behavior.

```bash
openflow validate <workflow-file>
```

Example:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

Validation checks include:

- `meta` is the first top-level statement.
- `meta.name` and `meta.description` are present.
- Metadata is statically analyzable.
- Unsupported imports and restricted APIs are rejected.
- Unsupported DSL functions such as `pipeline()` are rejected in MVP.

### `openflow doctor`

Checks local environment readiness.

```bash
openflow doctor
```

Typical checks:

- Config file can be loaded.
- Provider CLIs are present when configured.
- `codex` is available for Codex workflows.
- `gemini` is available for Gemini workflows.
- Required provider commands can be executed.
- Secret-like environment values are not printed.

---

## Workflow Metadata

Every workflow must begin with a static metadata export.

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "workflow-name",
  description: "Human-readable workflow description",
  phases: ["scan", "review", "summarize"]
};
```

Rules:

- `meta` must be the first top-level statement.
- `meta.name` is required.
- `meta.description` is required.
- `meta.phases` is optional.
- Dynamic expressions are rejected.

Valid:

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "review",
  description: "Review changed files"
};
```

Invalid:

```ts
const name = "review";

export const meta = {
  name,
  description: "Review changed files"
};
```

---

## Workflow DSL

OpenFlow workflows run in a constrained runtime. The MVP exposes a small DSL.

### `agent(input)`

Runs a provider-backed agent task.

```ts
const result = await agent({
  id: "review-auth",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: "Review src/auth.ts for correctness and security issues."
});
```

Supported input:

```ts
type AgentCallInput = {
  id?: string;
  label?: string;
  provider?: "codex" | "gemini" | "mock" | string;
  prompt: string;
  model?: string;
  schema?: JsonSchema;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  cwd?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

### `parallel(tasks)`

Runs independent tasks under the configured global concurrency limit.

Object form:

```ts
const reviews = await parallel({
  auth: () => agent({
    id: "review-auth",
    prompt: "Review src/auth.ts"
  }),
  billing: () => agent({
    id: "review-billing",
    prompt: "Review src/billing.ts"
  })
});
```

Array form:

```ts
const files = ["src/auth.ts", "src/billing.ts"];

const reviews = await parallel(
  files.map(file => () => agent({
    id: `review:${file}`,
    prompt: `Review ${file}`
  }))
);
```

### `phase(name)`

Marks the current workflow phase.

```ts
phase("review");
```

### `log(message, data?)`

Adds a workflow log event.

```ts
log("Starting review", { files: 2 });
```

---

## Structured Output

Agent calls can request structured output by providing a JSON Schema.

```ts
const result = await agent({
  id: "review-auth",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: "Return review findings as JSON.",
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      file: { type: "string" },
      findings: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "string"
        }
      }
    },
    required: ["file", "findings"]
  }
});
```

When a schema is provided, OpenFlow attempts to normalize provider output in this order:

1. Provider-native structured output, when available.
2. Provider JSON output, when available.
3. First valid JSON object or block extracted from stdout.
4. Schema validation failure if no valid JSON is available.

A validation failure is returned as a failed agent result and persisted as an artifact.

---

## Configuration

By default, OpenFlow loads:

```text
.openflow/config.yaml
```

Example:

```yaml
defaultProvider: codex
concurrency: 4
timeoutMs: 900000

providers:
  codex:
    command: codex
    args:
      - exec
      - --json
      - --ephemeral
    defaultModel: null

  gemini:
    command: gemini
    args:
      - --output-format
      - json
    defaultModel: gemini-2.5-flash

  mock:
    command: mock
    responses:
      default:
        text: "mock response"

security:
  passEnv: []
  redactEnv:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
    - GEMINI_API_KEY
    - GOOGLE_API_KEY
    - '*_TOKEN'
    - '*_SECRET'
```

Configuration precedence:

1. CLI safety ceilings and hard overrides.
2. Explicit `agent()` options.
3. Workflow defaults, if introduced later.
4. Config file.
5. Built-in defaults.

`--provider` sets the default provider. It does not override an explicit provider inside an `agent()` call.

---

## Model Selection

Model selection can be configured globally, per provider, on the command line, or explicitly within workflows.

### Precedence Rules

When resolving which model to use for an agent task, OpenFlow applies the following precedence (from strongest to weakest):

1. **Per-agent model**: Defined explicitly in the workflow script: `agent({ model: "model-name" })`.
2. **CLI override**: Provided via the `--model` (or `-m`) option: `openflow run workflow.ts --model model-name`.
3. **Provider-specific default model**: Configured in `.openflow/config.yaml` under `providers.<provider>.defaultModel`.
4. **Global default model**: Configured in `.openflow/config.yaml` under `defaultModel`.
5. **Provider default**: If no model is configured, the provider's CLI decides.

### Provider Flag Customization (`modelArg`)

By default, the `codex` provider CLI uses `--model <model>` and the `gemini` provider CLI uses `-m <model>`. You can customize this flag or disable model selection entirely for any provider in `.openflow/config.yaml`:

```yaml
defaultModel: gemini-2.5-flash # Global default model

providers:
  codex:
    command: codex
    modelArg:
      flag: --custom-model-flag # Custom flag instead of default --model
      
  gemini:
    command: gemini
    modelArg: false # Disable model selection (errors if a model is requested)
```

---

## Reports

OpenFlow supports three report modes.

### Pretty

Default local terminal output:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report pretty
```

Example output:

```text
◇ parallel-review
  Phase: review

  ✓ codex-review       codex    18.3s
  ✕ gemini-review      gemini   failed

Artifacts:
  .openflow/runs/20260602-abc123
```

### JSON

Prints only the final workflow report JSON object to stdout.

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report json
```

### JSONL

Streams ordered execution events to stdout.

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
```

JSONL is intended for CI jobs, dashboards, and tools that want to consume live workflow events.

---

## Artifacts

Every run creates a local artifact directory.

```text
.openflow/runs/<runId>/
  manifest.json
  workflow.input.ts
  config.resolved.json
  events.jsonl
  report.json
  agents/
    <agentId>/
      prompt.txt
      stdout.log
      stderr.log
      raw-result.json
      normalized-result.json
      schema.json
      validation-error.json
```

Artifacts are always enabled so failed or partial runs remain debuggable.

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Workflow failed |
| 2 | Invalid CLI usage |
| 3 | Workflow parse or validation error |
| 4 | Provider unavailable |
| 5 | Security policy violation |
| 6 | User cancelled |
| 7 | Timeout |
| 8 | Internal error |

---

## Safety Model

OpenFlow is safe by default, but the MVP should not be described as a complete security sandbox.

Default MVP behavior:

- Workflow shell execution is unavailable.
- Arbitrary workflow imports are unavailable.
- Environment variables are not passed unless allowlisted.
- Secret-like values are redacted from terminal output, events, reports, and persisted logs where feasible.
- Provider prompts and outputs are stored as artifacts.
- Patches are never applied automatically.
- Provider CLIs may still access files, network, and credentials according to their own behavior and permissions.

Be careful before sharing `.openflow/runs/<runId>` artifacts, because they may contain prompts, source snippets, stdout, stderr, and model outputs.

---

## CI Usage

Example GitHub Actions-style command:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
openflow run workflows/review.ts \
  --provider mock \
  --report json \
  --concurrency 2 \
  --timeout-ms 600000
```

For streaming logs:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
```

For deterministic CI tests, prefer the `mock` provider.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Provider CLI is missing

Run:

```bash
openflow doctor
```

If `codex` or `gemini` is missing, install the relevant provider CLI and ensure it is available in `PATH`.

### Workflow validation fails

Run:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

Check that:

- `export const meta = ...` is the first top-level statement.
- Metadata values are literals.
- The workflow does not use `require()`, arbitrary imports, filesystem APIs, process APIs, shell commands, or unsupported DSL functions.

### JSON report contains failed agents

Inspect the run artifacts:

```bash
cat .openflow/runs/<runId>/report.json
cat .openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/stderr.log
cat .openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/validation-error.json
```

### Agent output failed schema validation

Check:

```bash
.openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/raw-result.json
.openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/validation-error.json
```

Then update the prompt, schema, or provider output format.

---

## Example Workflows

### Parallel Code Review

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "parallel-code-review",
  description: "Review files in parallel",
  phases: ["review"]
};

const files = ["src/auth.ts", "src/billing.ts"];

phase("review");

const reviews = await parallel(
  files.map(file => () => agent({
    id: `review:${file}`,
    provider: "codex",
    prompt: `Review ${file} for correctness and maintainability issues.`,
    schema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        file: { type: "string" },
        findings: {
          type: "array",
          items: { type: "string" }
        }
      },
      required: ["file", "findings"]
    }
  }))
);

export default {
  reviews
};
```

### Test Failure Triage

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "test-failure-triage",
  description: "Analyze failing tests and propose next steps"
};

phase("triage");

const result = await agent({
  id: "triage",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: "Inspect the failing tests and propose the smallest safe fix."
});

export default result;
```

---

## Development

Suggested local development commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
```

Recommended test coverage:

- Config loading and precedence
- Metadata parsing
- Workflow validation restrictions
- Event sequencing
- Artifact generation
- Scheduler concurrency behavior
- Process timeout behavior
- Schema validation success and failure
- Provider command construction
- Mock provider integration workflows

---

## Design Principles

OpenFlow follows these boundaries:

1. Workflow DSL does not know provider-specific details.
2. Runtime does not spawn processes directly.
3. Provider adapters do not own workflow failure policy.
4. Process execution is provider-agnostic.
5. Structured output validation is local and provider-independent.
6. Reporters consume events but do not control execution.
7. Artifact storage is central to observability and debugging.
