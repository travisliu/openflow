# OpenFlow CLI

OpenFlow is a local-first command-line workflow runner for Codex-first dynamic workflows.

It lets engineers define constrained JavaScript-like workflows, run agent tasks sequentially or in parallel, capture structured results, and persist durable run artifacts for local debugging and CI automation.

## Why OpenFlow?

Modern coding agents are useful from the terminal, but larger engineering tasks often need more than one prompt or one agent run. OpenFlow provides a small orchestration layer around external coding-agent CLIs so you can:

- Split large engineering tasks into repeatable workflow files.
- Run multiple agent reviews in parallel.
- Run Codex review, analysis, and synthesis steps with repeatable workflow scripts.
- Validate structured JSON output with JSON Schema.
- Capture prompts, stdout, stderr, normalized results, reports, and events.
- Use pretty terminal output locally or JSON/JSONL output in CI.
- Keep provider-specific details out of workflow logic.

OpenFlow does **not** implement its own coding agent. It coordinates external provider CLIs.

---

## Features

- `openflow run <workflow-file>`
- `openflow validate <workflow-file>`
- `openflow doctor`
- Constrained workflow metadata parsing
- Workflow DSL functions:
  - `agent()`
  - `pause()`
  - `parallel()`
  - `pipeline()`
  - `phase()`
  - `log()`
- Provider adapters:
  - `mock`
  - `codex`
  - `gemini`
- Global concurrency limits

- Deterministic exit codes

Future roadmap features include plugin providers, retries, worktree/container isolation, approval gates, automatic patch application, and static HTML reports.

---

## Requirements

OpenFlow is designed for Node.js-based projects and local or CI environments.

Recommended baseline:

- Node.js 20+
- npm, pnpm, or yarn
- Git, when running inside a repository
- Provider CLI:
  - Codex CLI for the default `codex` provider
  - Gemini CLI is still available for explicit `gemini` workflows, but Codex is the default path.

The `mock` provider is intended for tests, examples, and CI workflows that should not require real provider credentials.

---

## Installation & Usage

### Usage with npx

Run without installing globally:

```bash
npx @prmflow/openflow --help
npx @prmflow/openflow doctor
npx @prmflow/openflow validate workflows/review.ts
npx @prmflow/openflow run workflows/review.ts
```

### Global installation

```bash
npm install -g @prmflow/openflow
openflow --help
openflow doctor
```

### Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx . --help
npx . run workflows/review.ts
```

### Local package smoke test

```bash
npm pack
npx ./prmflow-openflow-0.2.0.tgz --help
npx ./prmflow-openflow-0.2.0.tgz doctor
```

---

## Quick Start

Create a workflow file:

```ts
// workflows/review.ts
export const meta = {
  name: "parallel-review",
  description: "Review changed files with parallel Codex agents",
  phases: ["review", "summarize"]
};

phase("review");

const reviews = await parallel({
  correctness: () => agent("Review the changed files for correctness issues.", {
    id: "correctness-review"
  }),
  security: () => agent("Review the changed files for security issues.", {
    id: "security-review"
  })
});

phase("summarize");

const summary = await agent("Summarize these reviews and deduplicate findings:\n" + JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2), {
  id: "summary",
});

export default {
  reviews,
  summary
};
```

Run it:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts
```

Validate it without invoking providers:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

Run a dry run:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --dry-run
```

---

## Using the Mock Provider

The mock provider is useful for local examples, tests, and CI jobs that should not call external model providers.

```ts
// workflows/mock-review.ts
export const meta = {
  name: "mock-review",
  description: "Example workflow using the mock provider"
};

phase("review");

const result = await agent({
  id: "mock-review",
  provider: "mock",
  prompt: "Review the changed files."
});

export default result;
```

Run:

```bash
openflow run workflows/mock-review.ts --provider mock
```

---

## CLI Commands

### `openflow run`

Runs a workflow file.

```bash
openflow run <workflow-file> [options]
```

Common options:

```bash
--provider <codex|gemini|mock>
--arg key=value
--config <path>
--cwd <path>
--out <path>
--report <pretty|json|jsonl>
--concurrency <number>
--timeout-ms <number>
--max-agent-calls <number>
--max-observed-tokens <number>
--max-run-ms <ms>
--resume <run-id-or-path>
--no-cache
--background
--dry-run
--fail-fast
--verbose
```

Examples:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts
openflow run workflows/review.ts --provider codex
openflow run workflows/review.ts --concurrency 2
openflow run workflows/review.ts --timeout-ms 600000
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report json
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
openflow run workflows/review.ts --fail-fast
openflow run workflows/review.ts --resume <previous-run-id>
openflow run workflows/review.ts --background
```

`--timeout-ms` is a per-agent timeout. `--max-run-ms` is a workflow-level wall-clock budget.

Resume/cache only reuses successful agent calls from the same workflow hash. OpenFlow records every call in `calls.jsonl`; if `cache-index.json` is missing or damaged, resume rebuilds safe cache hits from that journal. `--no-cache` disables reads and cache-index writes, but keeps the call journal for debugging.

OpenFlow does not estimate token usage. For Codex runs, it records usage reported by `codex exec --json` and can stop later work with `--max-observed-tokens` after observed usage exceeds the limit.

### `openflow resume`

Continues a workflow that stopped at `pause()`.

```bash
openflow resume <runId-or-path> [input]
openflow resume <runId-or-path> --pause <pauseId> --input <value>
openflow resume <runId-or-path> --pause <pauseId> --input-file decision.json
```

If the pending run has exactly one pause, `--pause` can be omitted. Resume creates a new run, replays the workflow, reuses successful pre-pause agent calls through same-workflow cache, returns the supplied pause input, and continues from there. The original pending run remains as an audit record.

### `openflow validate`

Validates workflow metadata, syntax, and restricted behavior.

```bash
openflow validate <workflow-file>
```

Example:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

Validation checks include:

- `meta` is the first top-level statement.
- `meta.name` and `meta.description` are present.
- Metadata is statically analyzable.
- Unsupported imports and restricted APIs are rejected.
- `pipeline()` stage configuration and structure are verified.

### Run observation commands

```bash
openflow list --out .openflow/runs
openflow inspect <runId>
openflow watch <runId>
openflow watch <runId> --jsonl
openflow kill <runId>
```

Background and pending runs use the same artifact files as foreground runs. `watch` follows `events.jsonl` and exits when a run reaches `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `pending`. `inspect` reads `report.json`, `manifest.json`, and `process.json`.

### `openflow doctor`

Checks local environment readiness.

```bash
openflow doctor
```

Typical checks:

- Config file can be loaded.
- Provider CLIs are present when configured.
- `codex` is available for Codex workflows.
- `gemini` is available for Gemini workflows.
- Required provider commands can be executed.
- Secret-like environment values are not printed.

---

## Workflow Metadata

Every workflow must begin with a static metadata export.

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "workflow-name",
  description: "Human-readable workflow description",
  phases: ["scan", "review", "summarize"]
};
```

Rules:

- `meta` must be the first top-level statement.
- `meta.name` is required.
- `meta.description` is required.
- `meta.phases` is optional.
- Dynamic expressions are rejected.

Valid:

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "review",
  description: "Review changed files"
};
```

Invalid:

```ts
const name = "review";

export const meta = {
  name,
  description: "Review changed files"
};
```

---

## Workflow DSL

OpenFlow workflows run in a constrained runtime. The runtime exposes a clean, expressive DSL.

### `agent(input)`

Runs a provider-backed agent task.

```ts
const result = await agent({
  id: "review-auth",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: "Review src/auth.ts for correctness and security issues."
});
```

Supported input:

```ts
type AgentCallInput = {
  id?: string;
  label?: string;
  provider?: "codex" | "gemini" | "mock" | string;
  prompt: string;
  model?: string;
  schema?: JsonSchema;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  cwd?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

### `parallel(tasks)`

Runs independent tasks under the configured global concurrency limit.

Object form:

```ts
const reviews = await parallel({
  auth: () => agent({
    id: "review-auth",
    prompt: "Review src/auth.ts"
  }),
  billing: () => agent({
    id: "review-billing",
    prompt: "Review src/billing.ts"
  })
});
```

Array form:

```ts
const files = ["src/auth.ts", "src/billing.ts"];

const reviews = await parallel(
  files.map(file => () => agent({
    id: `review:${file}`,
    prompt: `Review ${file}`
  }))
);
```

### `pause(id, options)`

Stops the current workflow in `pending` state and asks the caller for input.

```ts
const decision = await pause("approve-plan", {
  message: "Review the plan before implementation.",
  data: { plan }
});
```

Resume with:

```bash
openflow resume <runId> "continue with the plan"
```

With a schema, resume input must be JSON and the workflow receives the validated object:

```ts
const decision = await pause("approve-plan", {
  message: "Approve or revise the plan.",
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      action: { type: "string", enum: ["approve", "revise"] },
      instruction: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["action"]
  }
});
```

`pause()` must use a stable non-empty id. It is intentionally unsupported inside `parallel()` branches and `pipeline()` stages.

### `phase(name)`

Marks the current workflow phase.

```ts
phase("review");
```

### `log(message, data?)`

Adds a workflow log event.

```ts
log("Starting review", { files: 2 });
```

### `pipeline(items, stages, options?)`

Processes an array of input items through a sequence of stage objects sequentially or concurrently depending on the strategy.

```ts
const pipelineResults = await pipeline(
  ["src/auth.ts", "src/billing.ts"],
  [
    {
      name: "lint",
      run: async (file, ctx) => {
        ctx.log(`Linting ${file}`);
        const res = await ctx.agent({
          id: ctx.agentId("lint"),
          prompt: `Find lint errors in ${file}`
        });
        return { file, result: res.text };
      }
    }
  ],
  {
    strategy: "item-streaming", // or "stage-barrier"
    concurrency: 2,
    preserveOrder: true
  }
);
```

Supported options:
- `strategy`: `"item-streaming"` (processes each item completely through all stages concurrently) or `"stage-barrier"` (processes all items through stage 1 before starting stage 2). Default is `"item-streaming"`.
- `concurrency`: Global max concurrent items/stages processing.
- `stageConcurrency`: Object mapping stage name to specific concurrency value.
- `preserveOrder`: Boolean to keep the output in the same order as items. Default is `true`.
- `failFast`: Boolean to stop processing on first item/stage failure.

The `PipelineStageContext` (`ctx`) object passed to each stage contains:
- `pipelineId` and `runId` (strings)
- `itemIndex` and `stageIndex` (numbers)
- `stageName` (string)
- `agent(input)`: Run an agent call with guaranteed scoped context.
- `log(message, data?)`: Log pipeline-specific messages.
- `agentId(suffix?)`: Helper to generate a unique agent ID.
- `signal`: AbortSignal for the stage.
- `sleep(ms)`: Utility to pause execution within the stage.

Workflows can use normal JavaScript `for` and `while` loops. For cache-friendly loops, give every agent call a stable id such as `fix-${round}` or `review-${round}`. OpenFlow does not intercept CPU-only infinite loops; use explicit round limits, budgets, or periodic `pause()` calls for long-running workflows.

---

## Structured Output

Agent calls can request structured output by providing a JSON Schema. `schema` is the validation contract; `structuredOutput.transport` controls how that schema reaches the provider.

```ts
const result = await agent({
  id: "review-auth",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: "Return review findings as JSON.",
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      file: { type: "string" },
      findings: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "string"
        }
      }
    },
    required: ["file", "findings"]
  },
  structuredOutput: {
    transport: "auto"
  }
});
```

Transport options:

- `auto`: use Codex native `--output-schema` when available, otherwise use prompt injection and local validation.
- `prompt`: always inject the schema into the prompt before invoking the provider.
- `validate-only`: do not inject the schema into the prompt; only validate the returned output locally.
- `native`: require provider-native structured output support. The default Codex adapter path supports this through `--output-schema`.

When a schema is provided, OpenFlow attempts to normalize provider output in this order:

1. Provider-specific structured JSON, when the adapter can identify it.
2. Provider JSON output, when available.
3. First valid JSON object or block extracted from stdout.
4. Schema validation failure if no valid JSON is available.

A validation failure is returned as a failed agent result and persisted as an artifact.

---

## Configuration

By default, OpenFlow loads:

```text
.openflow/config.yaml
```

Example:

```yaml
defaultProvider: codex
concurrency: 4
timeoutMs: 900000

providers:
  codex:
    command: codex
    args:
      - exec
      - --json
      - --ephemeral
    defaultModel: null

  gemini:
    command: gemini
    args:
      - --output-format
      - json
    defaultModel: gemini-3-flash-preview

  mock:
    command: mock
    responses:
      default:
        text: "mock response"

security:
  passEnv: []
  redactEnv:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
    - GEMINI_API_KEY
    - GOOGLE_API_KEY
    - '*_TOKEN'
    - '*_SECRET'
```

Configuration precedence:

1. CLI safety ceilings and hard overrides.
2. Explicit `agent()` options.
3. Workflow defaults, if introduced later.
4. Config file.
5. Built-in defaults.

`--provider` sets the default provider. It does not override an explicit provider inside an `agent()` call.

---

## Model Selection

Model selection can be configured globally, per provider, on the command line, or explicitly within workflows.

### Precedence Rules

When resolving which model to use for an agent task, OpenFlow applies the following precedence (from strongest to weakest):

1. **Per-agent model**: Defined explicitly in the workflow script: `agent({ model: "model-name" })`.
2. **CLI override**: Provided via the `--model` (or `-m`) option: `openflow run workflow.ts --model model-name`.
3. **Provider-specific default model**: Configured in `.openflow/config.yaml` under `providers.<provider>.defaultModel`.
4. **Global default model**: Configured in `.openflow/config.yaml` under `defaultModel`.
5. **Provider default**: If no model is configured, the provider's CLI decides.

### Provider Flag Customization (`modelArg`)

By default, the `codex` provider CLI uses `--model <model>` and the `gemini` provider CLI uses `-m <model>`. You can customize this flag or disable model selection entirely for any provider in `.openflow/config.yaml`:

```yaml
defaultModel: gemini-3-flash-preview # Global default model

providers:
  codex:
    command: codex
    modelArg:
      flag: --custom-model-flag # Custom flag instead of default --model
      
  gemini:
    command: gemini
    modelArg: false # Disable model selection (errors if a model is requested)
```

---

## Reports

OpenFlow supports three report modes.

### Pretty

Default local terminal output:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report pretty
```

Example output:

```text
◇ parallel-review
  Phase: review

  ✓ codex-review       codex    18.3s
  ✕ gemini-review      gemini   failed

Artifacts:
  .openflow/runs/20260602-abc123
```

### JSON

Prints only the final workflow report JSON object to stdout.

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report json
```

### JSONL

Streams ordered execution events to stdout.

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
```

JSONL is intended for CI jobs, dashboards, and tools that want to consume live workflow events.

---

## Artifacts

Every run creates a local artifact directory.

```text
.openflow/runs/<runId>/
  manifest.json
  workflow.input.ts
  config.resolved.json
  events.jsonl
  calls.jsonl
  cache-index.json
  pause-index.json
  process.json
  report.json
  agents/
    <agentId>/
      prompt.txt
      stdout.log
      stderr.log
      raw-result.json
      normalized-result.json
      cache-hit.json
      schema.json
      validation-error.json
  pauses/
    <pauseId>/
      pause.json
      resume-input.json
```

Artifacts are always enabled so failed, partial, or pending runs remain debuggable.

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Workflow failed |
| 2 | Invalid CLI usage |
| 3 | Workflow parse or validation error |
| 4 | Provider unavailable |
| 5 | Security policy violation |
| 6 | User cancelled |
| 7 | Timeout |
| 8 | Internal error |
| 9 | Workflow pending |

---

## Safety Model

OpenFlow is safe by default, but should not be described as a complete security sandbox.

Default security behavior:

- Workflow shell execution is unavailable.
- Arbitrary workflow imports are unavailable.
- Environment variables are not passed unless allowlisted.
- Secret-like values are redacted from terminal output, events, reports, and persisted logs where feasible.
- Provider prompts and outputs are stored as artifacts.
- Patches are never applied automatically.
- Provider CLIs may still access files, network, and credentials according to their own behavior and permissions.

Be careful before sharing `.openflow/runs/<runId>` artifacts, because they may contain prompts, source snippets, stdout, stderr, and model outputs.

---

## CI Usage

Example GitHub Actions-style command:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
openflow run workflows/review.ts \
  --provider mock \
  --report json \
  --concurrency 2 \
  --timeout-ms 600000
```

For streaming logs:

```bash
openflow run workflows/review.ts --report jsonl
```

For deterministic CI tests, prefer the `mock` provider.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Provider CLI is missing

Run:

```bash
openflow doctor
```

If `codex` or `gemini` is missing, install the relevant provider CLI and ensure it is available in `PATH`.

### Workflow validation fails

Run:

```bash
openflow validate workflows/review.ts
```

Check that:

- `export const meta = ...` is the first top-level statement.
- Metadata values are literals.
- The workflow does not use `require()`, arbitrary imports, filesystem APIs, process APIs, shell commands, or unsupported DSL functions.

### JSON report contains failed agents

Inspect the run artifacts:

```bash
cat .openflow/runs/<runId>/report.json
cat .openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/stderr.log
cat .openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/validation-error.json
```

### Agent output failed schema validation

Check:

```bash
.openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/raw-result.json
.openflow/runs/<runId>/agents/<agentId>/validation-error.json
```

Then update the prompt, schema, or provider output format.

---

## Example Workflows

### Parallel Code Review

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "parallel-code-review",
  description: "Review files in parallel",
  phases: ["review"]
};

const files = ["src/auth.ts", "src/billing.ts"];

phase("review");

const reviews = await parallel(
  files.map(file => () => agent({
    id: `review:${file}`,
    provider: "codex",
    prompt: `Review ${file} for correctness and maintainability issues.`,
    schema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        file: { type: "string" },
        findings: {
          type: "array",
          items: { type: "string" }
        }
      },
      required: ["file", "findings"]
    }
  }))
);

export default {
  reviews
};
```

### Test Failure Triage

```ts
export const meta = {
  name: "test-failure-triage",
  description: "Analyze failing tests and propose next steps"
};

phase("triage");

const result = await agent({
  id: "triage",
  provider: "codex",
  prompt: "Inspect the failing tests and propose the smallest safe fix."
});

export default result;
```

## Agent Skills

For AI/coding agents developing workflows in this repository, a pre-configured skill is located at [skills/openflow-workflow-writer/](file:///root/projects/execflow/skills/openflow-workflow-writer/). 

This directory contains:
- [SKILL.md](file:///root/projects/execflow/skills/openflow-workflow-writer/SKILL.md): Instructions and guidelines for AI agents to write, validate, and troubleshoot OpenFlow workflows.
- Reference documentation under [references/](file:///root/projects/execflow/skills/openflow-workflow-writer/references/):
  - [api-document.md](file:///root/projects/execflow/skills/openflow-workflow-writer/references/api-document.md): Complete guide on workflow syntax, DSL primitives (`agent`, `parallel`, `pipeline`), structured outputs, and exit codes.
  - [cli-commands.md](file:///root/projects/execflow/skills/openflow-workflow-writer/references/cli-commands.md): Detailed usage details for the `run`, `validate`, and `doctor` commands.
  - [configuration.md](file:///root/projects/execflow/skills/openflow-workflow-writer/references/configuration.md): Schema structure, precedence rules, and model customization guidelines for `.openflow/config.yaml`.
- Reusable templates under `assets/` for building new workflows.

---

## Design Principles

OpenFlow follows these boundaries:

1. Workflow DSL does not know provider-specific details.
2. Runtime does not spawn processes directly.
3. Provider adapters do not own workflow failure policy.
4. Process execution is provider-agnostic.
5. Structured output validation is local and provider-independent.
6. Reporters consume events but do not control execution.
7. Artifact storage is central to observability and debugging.
